explain to me unary operators in coding as if I were a child

Alright, imagine you have some building blocks, and each block represents a number or a piece of information. Unary operators are like special tools that help you do different things with just one block at a time.

Let's say you have a block with the number 5 on it. Now, if you want to make it a negative number, you can use a unary operator called the "minus" or "negation" operator. It's like putting a magic hat on the block that turns the number from 5 to -5.

So, if you started with a happy block that says 5, after using the magic hat (minus operator), it becomes a grumpy block with -5. The magic hat works only on that specific block and doesn't affect any other blocks nearby.

Unary operators are like special tools that do something special to just one block at a time. They help you change, flip, or transform the information on a single block without needing a whole bunch of blocks.
